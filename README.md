**Labdhi02/ProductManagement**  

---

## **Project Overview**
This project is a **Product Management System** built with **ASP.NET Core .NET 8 MVC**.  
It demonstrates **CRUD operations** using **Entity Framework Core** for database management and **data validation** with annotations. Scaffolding was utilized to quickly generate controllers and views, providing an efficient way to manage product data.  

This app is a foundational structure for building more advanced ASP.NET applications.
